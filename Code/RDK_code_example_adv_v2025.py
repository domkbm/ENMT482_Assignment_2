# A slightly more advanced example with joint array and HT matrix movements
# NOTE: an HT matrix is not unique, there are many solutions for a given pose which could result in
# unexpected robot poses. Therefore, it is recommended that joint angle arrays are used as 
# intermediate points (as shown), since these are unique and will ensure the robot goes to an 
# expected position before going to a pose defined by a calculated HT matrix.
